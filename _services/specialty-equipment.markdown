### Specialty & Custom Manufacturing Equipment
This automated leak test tank and conveyance system was designed to replace a manual system of operators pushing air conditioning coils along with a pallet down a manual roller conveyor. The prior system not only was causing back injury to the operators but also damaging the very thin aluminum fins on the coils. The new system now allows the operators to begin the leak test cycle by engaging a push button on the touch panel which begins the cycle of lowering the coil into the stainless steel water filled tank and being pressurizing the coil with 450 psi. The sides of the test tank come up and a steel mesh covers the area of the headers for operator safety. Once any leaks fixed the conveyor then takes it to the next station outside the tank which then upends the coil 45 degrees for water drainage. The coil then continues down line through various queues until it reaches a down-ender which then presents the coil in a vertical orientation for transfer to a bender with a manipulator.

A local customer needed a solution to a die storage and quick die exchange problem on a muffler assembly line. Special assembly dies are used to join the muffler internal components together into a cartridge on which the outer shell of the muffler is then wrapped and laser welded.

At the time, the dies were stored on the floor beside the press and moved by using a forklift. The dies were unusually tall and narrow making them top heavy and difficult to move safely especially by forklift. The die change was labor intensive
requiring two technicians plus a forklift driver to position the die in the press. Once in the press, locating the die required guesswork and pry bars as no locating aids were present.

Master Toolâ€™s solution was to build a die storage cart powered with a pneumatic motor and mounted on sub-floor mounted rails. The cart is controlled with the use of a hand-held  pendent which allows one technician to move, position the cart, and roll dies in and out of the press. The press bed was machined to accept multi-directional die rollers and locating stops for easy, dependable die locating without guesswork or additional tools.

Before the cart was installed, a die change took approximately thirty minutes and three technicians. After the cart was installed, die change takes less than 5 minutes and one technician.
