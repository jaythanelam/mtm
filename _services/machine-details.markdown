### Machining
Low volume details are machined on the conventional mills and lathes while high volume components or complex components are machined on our CNC milling machine. We are able to turn quotes around for detail work within 24 hours or less. Give us a chance to prove we can be competitive.

Using programmable machining software makes just about anything possible. We have the capabilities to download your drawings and make parts or we can design what you need upon your request and approval. With the addition of this software to our machining center, designs are stronger, construction is easier, performance of our tools is enhanced, and the project is more appealing to the eye.
