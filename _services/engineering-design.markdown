### Engineering & Custom Design
Master T&M can build to a customer’s design prints or designs can be provided as part of the project scope. Using AutoCAD and/or solid works software to design, we can find a solution to your problem. Our engineering group is committed to getting all the information required to develop a concept. The concept then becomes a sketch that can be visualized and from which a budget proposal can be provided to the customer.

Master Tool & Machine’s design group can design automated and integrated systems to produce a new component or be an addition to an existing process. Whether it is a steel shipping container, a pneumatically controlled ergonomic lift assist, or an overhead bridge crane, please consider Master T&M for your next project.

Master T&M will build to a customer’s Equipment Build Standards. If a customer does not have established standards, Master T&M will build the equipment to an in-house set of standards. Designs can be certified by a Professional Engineer upon request.

#### CASE STUDY:
A local company supplying rubber seals for the automotive industry contacted Master Tool & Machine with the problem of in process storage.

This company was removing the seals from the mold and placing them in long horizontal bins, creating several problems with this storage method.
- The use of the new carts created an increase in available floor space due to draping the seals over a saddle instead laying them in a bin.
- Quality was improved due to seals no longer being distorted.
- The total number of seals per cart was greater than what was in the bins.
- Fork trucks were no longer required to move the product since the carts were mobile, which allowed the aisle width to be reduced freeing up more space.

The customer was very pleased with the end result.
