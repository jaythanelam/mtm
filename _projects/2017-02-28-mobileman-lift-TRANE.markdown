#### YOUR PROJECT NAME
The issue presented was a safety concern. The operators were taking panels and attaching to a large air conditioning unit using ladders to hold the panels in position while having to attach them with screws.

The solution was to design and build an indexing unit to store and advance the panels along with a pneumatic lift platform to raise both the operators and the panels for assembly.  The two units were driven along the assembly line using a pneumatic motor and drive wheel mounted under the indexing cart.

#### Our Proposal
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
