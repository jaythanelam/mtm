#### YOUR PROJECT NAME
The task was to lift and 90 degree pitch various size spools of wire weighing up to 350 lbs.

The solution was to design and build a three jaw grip tool with manually adjusted jaws to clamp the various size spools.

#### Our Proposal
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
