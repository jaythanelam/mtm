#### YOUR PROJECT NAME
The customer needed to transfer heat exchangers without damaging them.

The solution was to design and build a vacuum tool with extended cup mounts and positive reference pads to locate the tool before vacuuming onto the surface.

#### Our Proposal
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
