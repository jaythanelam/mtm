#### YOUR PROJECT NAME
The customer needed to transfer cylinder shape silicon ingots from production down into a cardboard box for shipment.

The solution was to design and build a vacuum tool with floating wing cups for the various diameters and have a dual vacuum circuit along with a safety interlock for safe transfer and safety in the event of a single cup failure.

In addition the tool is supplied with green poppets to indicate vacuum for safe lifting.

#### Our Proposal
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
