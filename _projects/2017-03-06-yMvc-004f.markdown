#### YOUR PROJECT NAME
The Customer presented a challenge to reduce die change time on smaller press lines within a budget.

The solution was to design and build a manually operated die change cart with a rotating top for staging the next die in the line up to reduce down time on the press.

#### Our Proposal
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
