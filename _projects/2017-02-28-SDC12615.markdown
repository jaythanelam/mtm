#### YOUR PROJECT NAME
The Issue presented  was that the operators were crimping the copper tube when bending the tubing by hand.

#### Our Proposal
The Solution was to design and build a manually operated bending fixture used to bend copper tubing for final assembly in AC units. This fixture clamped the tube in location and supported the tube while bending around a fixed center post with a hinged bending lever attached to the fixture.
