#### YOUR PROJECT NAME
The task was to transfer and 180 degree rotate brake drums weighing up to 180 lbs.

The solution was to design and build a tool with pneumatic grip and air motor for rotation to complete the task.

#### Our Proposal
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
