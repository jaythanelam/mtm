#### YOUR PROJECT NAME
The task was to grip and 90 degree pitch brake drums weighing up to 180 lbs. when stacked next to each other on a pallet.

The solution was to design and build a compact two jaw tool to clamp drums in spaces between other drums , lift and pitch for transfer to assemble onto shaft.

#### Our Proposal
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
